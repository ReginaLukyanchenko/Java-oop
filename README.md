This project is a well-publicized entertainment - quest room. Its main difference lies in the fact that it is an online game in which the sence remains the same, namely, to leave the room as soon as possible, solving some puzzles. 

It will be implemented several levels (different rooms) with their own puzzles. On the passage of the level the player will be awarded some points. The faster the player finishes the level, the more points he earns. During the passage of the level, when a particular object will be found, the player will be shown hints where this object can be applied. At the request, the player can turn them off. 

At the end of the game, the player will be shown a total score and his rating among the other players.
